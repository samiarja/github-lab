I Sami El Arja, Undergrade Mechatronics Engineer who is passionate about Deep Learning and Artificiel Intelligence. My Mission is to persue a Master of Research in Computer Vision and Generative Models with the ability to publish my first paper about Machine learning. After I wanna persue a PhD in Deep Learning where I am hopping to be under the best Machine learning researchers, such as georffrey hinton yoshua bengio and peter abiel, and I wanna push harder to be in this position. My 10 years plan is to finish my Doctoral Degree and either be in a top 500 fortune company or building my own startup, at the end, It is all up to me. If i can prove that i can do amazing algorithm and software, i have no doubt that this plan will be true soon.
